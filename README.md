# Five-Dice-Game
also known as: 5-Dice or Dice 10,000
game for 2 players

The goal is to gain certain amount of points (this case 1000pt)

At the beginning players are drawing the order of rolling dice

First stage aim is to get at least 60 points 
and save it in order to proceed to the next stage.
Each round players can save current round points or attempt to score more points

Points are counted depending on a roll set:

- for 1x rolled 5: 5 points, or
- 2x 5: 10 pts
- 3x 5: 50 pts
- 4x 5: 100 pts
- 5x 5: 200 pts

each rolled 1: 10 points, or
- 2x 1: 20 pts
- 3x 1: 100 pts
- 4x 1: 200 pts
- 5x 1: 400 pts

for 2 (and 3, 4, 6):
- 1x 2: 0pts
- 2x 2: 0pts
- 3x 2: 20pts
- 4x 2: 40pts
- 5x 2: 80 pts and so on...


Rolling and gaining points:

If any points are gained from a roll set - round is over.
If any dices left after roll (some dices gained points but some not)- no-points dices can be used again.
If all dices from a roll set gained points - all 5 dices can be used again in a current round.
Player is able to save points as long as he get any points from last roll set
otherwise he looses all round points.
After saving points the round is over.

The player who scores 1000 points first - wins the game
